The platform, completely written from scratch, replaces the former outdated website and completely automates every portion of the process for students, chaperones, and admins. Approximately 85% of the sites content is dynamic, changing day-to-day and year-to-year based on the settings and data maintained by the admin panel. The list of features, explained below, are expansive, making this one of the largest, and most well received projects I have ever been apart of.<br><br> In total, the database has over 50 tables and views, the backend has over 100 endpoints, and the frontend has over 85 react components, all of which was created by a team of 3 developers, and minimal assistance from staff members. <br><br> Students can use the platform to create a profile, obtain guardian approval for their participation in the competition, create and manage teams, and to submit their pitch for adjudication. <br><br> Judges in the system can then view students pitches from the admin panel where they decide whether or not the pitch moves on to the in-person regional competition. At each regional competition, a winner and a runner up are decided. The winner moves directly on to the state competition, and the runner up is put in the wildcard voting system.<br><br> The Wildcard Voting System works automatically once a pitch has been marked as a wildcard. The system allows a user to vote once per day for their favorite pitch. To prevent spam voting, the system uses fingerprinting combined with recaptcha to reduce the risk of bot voting, and an individual voting multiple times. At the end of the wildcard period, the top two teams move onto the state competition, where a final winner is decided.<br><br>  The site, on top of the whole process, works as a content management system for photos and videos taken during the competitions. The videos can be viewed on the site, as well as information on past winners.",

The system is also completely integrated with Slack, so that admins can review reservations, and users can be notified of any important events. The Equipment Checkout System is an excellent example of one of the full stack solutions I have worked on.<br><br> The system is comprised of three frontends all written in Angular.js. The Scheduler frontend allows users to create new reservations or update existing ones. By utilizing a drag and drop calendar, users can select a time, and add items to their reservation. The system keeps track of what items or kits are available at what times, and differentiates between personal and official reservations. The Scanner frontend is responsible for allowing users to scan out and scan in their items when there reservation time slot is open. Finally, the Admin Panel allows admins to create or modify kits and items, as well are search through reservations and monitor the overall state of the system.<br><br> The backends of the system are split in two. The main backend is written in PHP and utilizes the Slim and PDO libraries. It is responsible for all of the complex logic required to determine eligibility of items, managing the state of all reservations, detecting late reservations, sending notifications and all other functionality for the daily operations of the system. The second backend, using Node.js and Swagger routing, is solely dedicated to managing Slack messaging.",

The purpose of the web-based platform is to increase awareness of the world-wide water crisis. The platform utilizes React.js, as well as many JS libraries in order to provide an interactive map, and content management system. This project is a prime example of my work with Component-based organization, and data manipulation.<br><br> My role on this project initially was to meet with the clients and discuss the feasibility of their initial designs for a web-based interactive experience. Through these direct meetings, the The Blue Roots crew were able to refine their vision for the site to on that was both visually appealing and functional interactive. As developers, the team from the Digital Corps then had to research and implement libraries and data protocols in order to assist with some of the more complicated features, such as the interactive map, geolocation services, and geofencing.<br><br> On top of these libraries, I organized the website, along with its data into an efficient component system. While efficiency and organization is a priority on any project, it was essential that the data manipulation on this website was as efficient as possible, as the browser’s resources were already being spread thin in order to render the map.",
